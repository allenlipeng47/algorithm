In Java, mutex can be done by Object synchronization or method synchronization.
When more than one thread call same method or object, and if there is no synchronization, then there is no order guarantee.
If we add synchronization on Object we use or method, then the object or method can be visited mutually exclusive.

NoSync.java shows an example when there is no mutex setup. So, there print 0 is in a mess.
SyncOnMethod uses synchronization on same method. So same method is visited mutually.
SyncOnVariable uses synchronization on same object, which is PrintDemo. So this object is visited mutually.
